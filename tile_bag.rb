# #### Modifications to `Player`
# Create specs for (__minimum 2__) and add to the `Player` class the following instance methods:
#
# - `#tiles` a collection of letters that the player can play (max 7)
# - `#draw_tiles(tile_bag)` fills tiles array until it has 7 letters from the given tile bag
#
# ### Optional Enhancements
# - Create a `Scrabble::Dictionary` class that includes a method (class or instance) for searching a list of words to determine if a given word is valid (__minimum of 5 specs__).
# - Create a `Scrabble::Board` class (__minimum of 15 specs__) that has a matrix (array of arrays) of tile places. Check if a word can be played on a given tile place in a certain direction (up/down or left/right).

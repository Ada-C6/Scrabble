######################
### Learning Goals ###
######################

[ ] Use Test Driven Development (TDD) to write tests and code in parallel
[ ] Create class and instance methods according to requirements
[ ] Utilize Single Responsibility Principle to reduce code dependencies
[ ] Utilize composition between classes, where appropriate

#########################
#### Agile Workflow #####
#########################

~ roles will switch every 30 minutes utilizing a timer
~ 5 minute check in after switch
~ feedback will be direct and spoken kindly and plainly

#### Project Expectations ####
##############################

[ ] from project root file 
    () execute specs files by running RAKE { }
[ ] lib should contain
    ( )  multiple files of ruby classess ( each ruby class gets its own file in lib) { }
    ( )  module named "Scrabble" encloses entire project { } 
[ ] Scrable::Scoring class contains data struture to store the individal letter scores as below

Letter                        Value

A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T   1
D, G                           2
B, C, M, P                     3
F, H, V, W, Y                  4
K                              5
J, X                           8
Q, Z                           10

[ ] utilize minitest specs format
[ ] organize tests into DESCRIBE blocks
[ ] use require { }
[ ] use require realtive { }
[ ] use include

#### WAVE 1 ####

[ ] Scrabble::Scoring class must have >= ** 8 ** specs   { }
    ( ) contains self.score(word)                         { }
        < > returns word score                             { }
        < > word input is a STRING                          { }
        < > seven letter words recieve a 50 PT BONUS          { }
[ ] self.highest_score_from(array_of_words)
    ( )  returns the word in the array with the highest score  { }
    ( ) IF tie
        ( ) word composed of fewest tiles wins                  { }
            UNLESS
        ( ) top score is a tie between multiple words and one 7 letter word  { }
             THEN
             7 letter word wins
        ( ) IF multiple words of == tile length and multiple words of == score { }
            Then first word in array wins
